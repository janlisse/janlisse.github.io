Having done a lot of Scala/Play development lately i just joined a new project based on Groovy & Grails.
A great opportunity to learn Play's competitor for the title [JVM's most productive webframework](http://www.ubertracks.com/preso/#/intro).
This post is NOT a bashing of dynamic typed languages or a conceptual evaluation at all.
I just want to cover some practical issues i encountered while building a vanilla webapp using latest Grails 2.4.4.
